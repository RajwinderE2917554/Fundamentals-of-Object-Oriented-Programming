# Fundamentals-of-Object-Oriented-Programming
1.	In the field of programming, Iteration Statements are helpful when we need a specific task in repetition. Theyâ€™re essential as they reduce hours of work to seconds. An iteration is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. As per given statement you need to implement the task using iterations. 
A number is said to be valid if it is divisible by 8. Develop a logic that allows the user to keep entering numbers as long as the input is valid and also displays a count of the valid numbers. 
Sample Input and Output:
Enter the number
8
Enter the number
16
Enter the number
96
Enter the number
6
Total 3 numbers are valid numbers. 


//code
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class valid{
    int num, count = 0;
    public:
    valid(){
        for(int i = 0;;i++){
            cout << "Enter number " << endl;
            cin >> num;
            if(num%8 == 0){
                count++;
            }
            else{
                break;
            }
        }
        cout << "Total " << count << " numbers are valid numbers."<<  endl;
    }
};
int main(){
valid obj;
return 0;
}
