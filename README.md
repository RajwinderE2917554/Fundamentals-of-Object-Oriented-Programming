# Fundamentals-of-Object-Oriented-Programming
1.	In the field of programming, Iteration Statements are helpful when we need a specific task in repetition. Theyâ€™re essential as they reduce hours of work to seconds. An iteration is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. As per given statement you need to implement the task using iterations. 
A number is said to be valid if it is divisible by 8. Develop a logic that allows the user to keep entering numbers as long as the input is valid and also displays a count of the valid numbers. 
Sample Input and Output:
Enter the number
8
Enter the number
16
Enter the number
96
Enter the number
6
Total 3 numbers are valid numbers.


#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int valid_count = 0;
    int num;

    while (true) {
        std::cout << "Enter the number: ";
        std::cin >> num;

        if (std::cin.fail()) {
            std::cout << "Invalid input. Please enter a valid integer." << std::endl;
            std::cin.clear();
            std::cin.ignore(256, '\n');
            continue;
        }

        if (num % 8 == 0) {
            valid_count++;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    std::cout << "Total " << valid_count << " numbers are valid numbers." << std::endl;

    return 0;
}
