 # Fundamentals-of-Object-Oriented-Programming
1.	In the field of programming, Iteration Statements are helpful when we need a specific task in repetition. Theyâ€™re essential as they reduce hours of work to seconds. An iteration is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. As per given statement you need to implement the task using iterations. 
A number is said to be valid if it is divisible by 8. Develop a logic that allows the user to keep entering numbers as long as the input is valid and also displays a count of the valid numbers. 
Sample Input and Output:
Enter the number
8
Enter the number
16
Enter the number
96
Enter the number
6
Total 3 numbers are valid numbers. 



#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class number{
	int n,j;
	static int count;
	public:
	void get_data(){
		while(1){
	cout<<"enter the numbers you want to check:- ";
	cin>>n;
	if(n%8==0){
				count++;		
}
else{		cout<<"total " <<count<< " numbers are valid number"<<endl;
				break;
			}	
			
	}
}
};int number::count=0;
int main(){
	number obj;
	obj.get_data();
	return 0;
}
