# Fundamentals-of-Object-Oriented-Programming
1.	In the field of programming, Iteration Statements are helpful when we need a specific task in repetition. Theyâ€™re essential as they reduce hours of work to seconds. An iteration is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. As per given statement you need to implement the task using iterations. 
A number is said to be valid if it is divisible by 8. Develop a logic that allows the user to keep entering numbers as long as the input is valid and also displays a count of the valid numbers. 
Sample Input and Output:
Enter the number
8
Enter the number
16
Enter the number
96
Enter the number
6
Total 3 numbers are valid numbers. 



#include<iostream>
using namespace std;
class abc{
    int n,count=0;
    public:
    void get_data()
    {
        
        while(1)
        {
            cout<<"enter the number "<<endl;
            cin>>n;
            if(n%8==0)
            {
                count++;
            }
            else {
                cout<<"numbers divisibe by 8 are "<<count<<endl;
            break;
             }
           
        }
    }

};
int main()
{
    abc a;
    a.get_data();
    return 0;
}
