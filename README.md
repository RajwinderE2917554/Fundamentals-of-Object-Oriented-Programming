# Fundamentals-of-Object-Oriented-Programming
1.	In the field of programming, Iteration Statements are helpful when we need a specific task in repetition. Theyâ€™re essential as they reduce hours of work to seconds. An iteration is a sequence of instructions that is continually repeated until a certain condition is reached. As per given statement you need to implement the task using iterations. 
A number is said to be valid if it is divisible by 8. Develop a logic that allows the user to keep entering numbers as long as the input is valid and also displays a count of the valid numbers. 
Sample Input and Output:
Enter the number
8
Enter the number
16
Enter the number
96
Enter the number
6
Total 3 numbers are valid numbers. 



#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() 
{
    int number;
    int count = 0;
    
    cout << "HIMKAR SINGLA , ROLL NO. 2310997106\n";

    cout << "Enter numbers. Enter 0 to stop.\n";

    do 
	{
        cout << "Enter the number: ";
        cin >> number;

        if (number % 8 == 0 && number != 0) 
		{
            count++;
        }

    } 
	while (number != 0);

    cout << "Total " << count << " numbers are valid." <<endl;

    return 0;
}
